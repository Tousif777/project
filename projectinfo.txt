# Private- FBA Shipment Automation

——————-
Project Overview
• This project aims to automate the calculation of inventory transfer quantities from the primary 3PL warehouse to Amazon FBA and generate the corresponding shipment file.
• The goal is to minimize FBA storage costs while preventing stockouts through efficient allocation based on sales trends.

⸻

Data Sources

To execute the logic, the following data sources are required:
• Sales performance data (for Amazon FBA and other channels): from Next Engine
• Inventory at 3PL locations: from Next Engine
• Current inventory at Amazon FBA: from Amazon Seller Central

⸻

Inventory Types in 3PL

Inventory is stored across the following three locations:

1. Main warehouse inventory
2. RSL (Rakuten Super Logistics) inventory
3. LOGI (external logistics warehouse) inventory

⸻

Inventory Allocation Logic

1. Sales-Based Allocation Calculation
• Use the past two weeks of sales data from both FBA and other channels to determine the allocation ratio.
• Example:
• FBA sales = 20 units
• Other channels = 50 units
• Total = 70 units → FBA : Others = 2 : 5
• If available inventory = 100 units:
• Theoretical allocation → FBA = 29, Others = 71
• However, if actual FBA sales (20) < theoretical FBA allocation (29),
then limit FBA shipment to 20 units
2. FBA Transfer Quantity Calculation
• Final quantity to send to FBA =
Calculated FBA allocation minus Current FBA inventory

⸻

3PL Inventory Allocation Logic

Once the required FBA transfer quantity is determined:

1. Subtract the quantity of RSL inventory from the main warehouse inventory. Define this result as A.
2. If the required quantity ≤ A, ship entirely from the main warehouse.
3. If the required quantity > A, ship A units from the main warehouse, and ship the remaining quantity from the LOGI warehouse.

⸻

Shipment File Filtering & Output

After calculating the items and quantities to ship to FBA:

1. Filter the list based on product type:
• Products eligible for mail-sized package delivery
• Products categorized as “60-size” (a standard shipping class)
2. Generate the final shipment list based on this filtered data for dispatch processing.

⸻

Automation Frequency & Optimization
• The automation process should run once every 7 to 10 days.
• The execution interval may be adjusted based on inventory turnover and performance data.
• Continuous improvement of the system will be driven by operational metrics and stockout/overstock avoidance results.
